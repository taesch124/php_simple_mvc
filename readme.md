# PHP MVC Framework

Simple PHP MVC Framework that allows you to build a web application over the core. The core provides loading of views and controllers for a multi page web application. Custom models and Controllers need to be built on top of this to make a working application.

This framework assumes that your Web Server is pointing directly at the public folder of the project. If your setup is different, the htaccess file will need to be adjusted."
